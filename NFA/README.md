/**
 * This program was created in webstrom nodejs to run the program
 * please use the following comment on the console to install synchronize read feature.
 * npm --save install readline-sync
 * We used graph structure to create a nfa from given regex.
 * Input string which is taken from user is being validated.
 * To generate postfix format shunting yard algorithm was used.
 * Regex input does not contain '.' needed "." is generated by edit_str function.
 * To run nfa_generator.js in the terminal use following command 
 * node nfa_generator.js
 *
 *
 * According to basic nfa operation;
 * operators are (*) star , (.) concat and (+) union.
 * other terminologies -> show start node, [] show node and [[]] show accept node, -a-> transition 'a'.
 * operand 'a' can be simulated like
 *  ->[node1]-a->[[node2]]
 *  a*(star) operation doing like
 *  ->[[node3]]-$->[node1]-a->[[node2]] and [[node2]]-$->[node1]
 *
 * a+b(union) operation doing as
 * ->[node3]-b->[[node4]] // b simulate like this than
 *
 *  ->[node5]-$->[node1]-a->[[node2]] and ->[node5]-$->[node3]-b->[[node4]]
 * 
 * a.b(concat) operation doing like
 * ->[node1]-a->[node2]-$->[node3]-b->[[node4]]
